Real-Time Dress Cart Shop

This app will allow users to browse dresses, add them to a shopping cart, proceed to checkout, and make orders. The app will include real-time cart updates, user authentication, and order management.

Features:

1. User Authentication:
    - Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profile.
    - Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication (signup/login).

2. Browse Dresses:
    - Users can browse a variety of dresses listed by category (e.g., Casual, Party, Formal, Seasonal).
    - Each dress has details like image, size options, price, and description.
    - Search and Filters: Users can filter dresses by category, size, color, or price.

3. Shopping Cart:
    - Users can add dresses to their cart, adjust quantities, or remove items.
    - The cart should update in real-time as users add or remove items.
    - The cart will show the total price, quantity, and item details.

4. Checkout:
    - Once users are ready to purchase, they can proceed to the checkout page.
    - On the checkout page, users can input their shipping address and payment details (simulated, as payment gateway integration can be added later).
    - Users will receive an order confirmation once the checkout process is completed.

5. Order History:
    - Users can view their order history after logging in, displaying all past orders with details such as items purchased, total price, and status (pending, completed).

6. Admin Dashboard:
    - Admin users (like the shop owner) can add, update, or delete dress listings.
    - Admins can see all order details, update order statuses (e.g., shipped, delivered), and manage inventory.

7. Real-Time Updates:
    - Whenever a user adds or removes an item from the cart, the cart updates in real-time (using React Context or Redux for state management).
    - Order status updates in real-time (e.g., when shipped).

8. Responsive Design:
    - Make the app responsive and mobile-friendly using CSS Grid, Flexbox, or libraries like Material-UI or Bootstrap.

Frontend (ReactJS):

React Components:
    - Login/Signup: For user authentication (JWT).
    - HomePage: Display a list of dresses available for sale, with filtering and search options.
    - Product Page: Display detailed information about a selected dress.
    - Cart Page: Display the contents of the shopping cart, allow users to update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
    - Checkout Page: Collect user shipping information and simulate payment.
    - Order History Page: Show the user’s past orders.
    - Admin Dashboard: Admin can add/edit/delete dresses, view orders, and manage inventory.

State Management:
    - Use React Context API or Redux for global state management:
        - Store the user’s authentication state.
        - Track the cart items (dress id, quantity, price).
        - Maintain order history and admin data.

Real-Time Updates:
    - Use React Context API or Redux for the real-time cart updates. The cart should immediately reflect any changes (e.g., adding/removing an item).
    - Use Polling or WebSockets to update order statuses in real-time.

UI Libraries:
    - Use Material UI or Bootstrap for styling.
    - Use React Router for page navigation between the homepage, product details, cart, checkout, and order history.
    - Formik for form handling (especially on the checkout page).

Backend (Node.js + Express):

Node.js with Express:
    - Set up an Express backend to handle API requests for:
        - User authentication (JWT)
        - Dress listing (CRUD)
        - Cart management (CRUD)
        - Checkout processing
        - Order history
        - Admin dashboard
    - Use bcrypt to hash user passwords.

Database:
    - Use MongoDB (or PostgreSQL) to store:
        - User Data: User profiles, authentication data.
        - Product Data: Dress details, categories, price, image URLs.
        - Order Data: User orders, order statuses (pending, shipped, delivered), and products in the order.
        - Cart Data: Track cart items for each logged-in user.

Authentication:
    - Use JWT for user authentication (sign-up, login) and managing user sessions.
    - Admin authentication: Admins can log in with special privileges.

Real-Time Updates:
    - WebSockets or setInterval to update cart data and order statuses in real-time.
    - When an order is placed, or when cart items change, notify the frontend.

Admin Features:
    - Create endpoints for adding, editing, and deleting dresses.
    - Admins can view all order details and update order statuses.

File Uploads:
    - Use Multer to handle image uploads (for product photos) or integrate with Cloudinary for better image hosting.
